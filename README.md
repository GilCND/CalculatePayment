# CalculatePayment
## Create an application that prompts an employee for an hourly pay rate and number of hours worked. 
### Compute their gross pay (hours times rate), withholding tax, and net pay (gross pay minus withholding tax). Withholding tax is computed as a percentage of gross pay based on the following:
### Gross Pay ($)                                             Withholding (%)
### 0 to 300.00                                                  10
### 300.01 to 400.00                                             12
### 400.01 to 500.00                                             15
### 500.01 and over                                              20
